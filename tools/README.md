# Tools

This directory contains a few small Python utility scripts that you might find
useful for working with Skywalker Python datasets (modules).

* `merge_ensembles`: merges two or more Skywalker datasets into a single
  dataset, producing corresponding `.yaml` and `.py` files
* `py2ncl`: translates a Skywalker dataset into an NCL data file

These scripts are installed in `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin`.
